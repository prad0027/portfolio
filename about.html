    <h1>About Sivasankar</h1>

    <p>
        Greetings! I am Sivasankar, a dedicated photographer and cinematographer hailing from the vibrant landscapes of India. My artistic journey led me from the rich visual tapestry of India to the creative realms of the United Kingdom. Currently, I am a student pursuing a degree in Interactive Media at Algonquin College in Canada.

    <p>
        Over the years, my commitment to visual storytelling has garnered recognition, including awards such as Best Assistant Cinematographer. Working alongside industry professionals has not only honed my technical skills but also broadened my understanding of the art of capturing moments.

    <p>
        As a wildlife photographer, my lens becomes a storyteller, capturing the untamed beauty of nature. From the dense jungles of India to the scenic landscapes of the United Kingdom and the diverse wildlife in Canada, each photograph is a testament to my passion for preserving the wonders of our planet.

        Currently immersed in the world of Interactive Media, I explore new avenues to blend technology with art. Every click is a step towards creating immersive and engaging visual experiences.
